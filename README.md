## ![icon](./icon/favicon-32x32.png) About me
I'm Enne, a transient being with a BS.Eng. and some letters behind her name. I spend my spare time going for walks, playing games and making things.

## ![icon](./icon/favicon-32x32.png) What I do for work
I'm a data engineer for a trade association. That entails designing data architecture, building queries and visualizations, writing documentation, training staff, and managing integrations with other systems. Trying to get to a point where most of my day can be spent programming instead. 


## ![icon](./icon/favicon-32x32.png) What I do for fun
I completed a data analytics bootcamp in May 2022 in an effort to be more efficient with programming languages. More recently, I've been learning Svelte hands-on, as well as familiarizing with Docker and Kubernetes via video learning courses.
